### Introduction
Provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for students to check for updates regarding available seats, on one of the most popular messaging platform in the university.
  
### Implementation
  The bot is written in Python with the use of Telegram Bot API libraries and MatPlotlib. In its preliminary stage of implementation, it accepts queries from users on the occupany information of a given location, and returns a set of data including:
  * Numerical occupancy status of the restaurant
  * Graphical map of the seats in the resstaurant, with each seat colored according to occupancy
  The query will be identified via push buttons that will appear in the bot chat log for the user to interact with.
